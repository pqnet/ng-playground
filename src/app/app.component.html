<!--
  Here is the template for the example Angular app content that you've seen on your browser.
  You may recognize most of it as plain HTML, with some caveats: firstly, it is not a complete
  html but only a fragment, this is because it doesn't represent the whole page but only a widget
  (although in this case the widget is enlarged full size on the page), secondly there are some
  {{}} that are likely template expression.

  And indeed they are: the expression inside {{}} are evaluated in a small subset of javascript
  and names are resolved in the context of the view model class. Try it, put your name as {{author}}
  somewhere in the page.
-->
<div style="text-align:center" class="content">
  <h1>
    Welcome to {{title}}!
  </h1>
  <span style="display: block">{{ title }} app is running!</span>
<!--
  The {{}} templates do work inside text nodes of the html, however if you want to set an attribute such as
  'alt', the alternative text for the image, you'll find that simply replacing with {{}} is not enough.
  Attributes can be bound as a whole to an expression by using the following syntax
  <img width="300" [alt]="imageAltText" src="..."/>
  enclosing an attribute in square bracket will make the compiler interpret the associated text as an 
  expression to evaluate each time the viewmodel changes to obtain the correct expression to evaluate.
  Set it to "imageAltText" as in the example above, then commit your changes and run "git pull --rebase"
  and open the file 'clock.component.ts' to continue with the tutorial.

  Here we use a structural directive to show either one or the other content based on the value of a variable.
  *ngIf takes an expression and show the element and its content only if the condition is true
  To have a else branch we just add another *ngIf with the opposite condition.
  `clockShown` is just another boolean public variable in the view model, initialized as true.
  Go check it.
-->
<div *ngIf="clockShown">
  <!-- This is another type of binding, which works in the opposite direction -->
  <button (click)="clockShown = false">Hide clock</button>
  <app-clock></app-clock>
</div>
<div *ngIf="!clockShown">
  <button (click)="clockShown = true">Show clock</button>
</div>
